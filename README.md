### Installation
To install NetworkStateManager, simply add the NetworkStateManager.swift file to your Xcode project and enjoy ðŸ™‚.

## ðŸ’» How to use

First create a `NetworkState` object and add it as an `environmentObject` to your root `View`.

```
import SwiftUI

@main
struct NetworkStateDemoApp: App {
    
    let networkState = NetworkState()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView().environmentObject(networkState)
        }
    }
}
```
use the `isConnected` variable to render out your UI. For more understanding download and run the project. 

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @EnvironmentObject var networkManager: NetworkManager
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Image(systemName: networkManager.isConnected ? "wifi" : "wifi.slash").font(.largeTitle)
            
            let status = networkManager.isConnected == true ? "Online" : "Offline"
            Text("You are \(status) and connected to \(networkManager.networkType?.rawValue ?? "")")
                .foregroundColor(.green)
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
### Customization
You can also customize the behavior of NetworkManager by subclassing it and overridding the methods you want to change.
